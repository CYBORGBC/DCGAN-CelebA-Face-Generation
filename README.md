# DCGAN-CelebA-Face-Generation
This project uses a DCGAN to generate realistic human faces from the CelebA dataset. It runs on Google Colab with GPU acceleration, importing data directly from Kaggle. The model includes a generator and discriminator, trained adversarially to improve face generation over time. Outputs are periodically visualized to track progress
